# Minecraft Shader Programming

This repository contains information and tutorials on how to write custom shaders for Minecraft use the Optifine mod. The tutorials start at the "Introduction" folder and then the "Tutorial N - ABCD" folders contain information on how to add a certain effect to your shader. The "Introduction" folder is not a shader pack, but the "Tutorial N - ABCD" is. For these tutorials the only requirement is a basic knowledge of graphics programming (you need to know everything up to the concept of rendering to a texture), although I plan to add another tutorial that explains all the basics in detail.
